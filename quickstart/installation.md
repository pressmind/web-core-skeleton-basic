# 1. Installation
* download the [latest release](https://github.com/pressmind/web-core-skeleton-basic/releases/latest)
* extract the sources to a directory on your webserver (for example /var/www/vhosts)
* create a MySQL database

```shell script
mysql -u root -p;
mysql> CREATE DATABASE my_new_database;
mysql> CREATE USER 'my_database_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'my_database_password';
mysql> GRANT ALL ON my_new_database.* TO 'my_database_user'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
``` 

* on a console move to the base folder

```shell script
cd /var/www/vhosts/web-core-skeleton-basic
```

* install composer dependencies

```shell script
composer install
```

* move to the application/cli directory and run the install.php script

```shell script
cd web-core-skeleton-basic/application/cli
php install.php
```

* you will be asked for some information on database and pressmind credentials

```shell script
Welcome to the initial installation of your new pressmind web-core project.
Please enter some initial configuration data.
Enter Database Host [127.0.0.1]:
Enter Database Port [3306]:
Enter Database Name: 
Enter Database Username: 
Enter Database User Password:
Enter Pressmind API Key:
Enter Pressmind API User:
Enter Pressmind API Password:
```

* This will install the necessary database tables and generate the needed model-definitions for the media object types.  
  Additionally some basic example php files that show the use of Views are generated in the folder /application/Custom/Views as well as some html files with information on the installed media object types. You can find these under httpdocs/docs/objecttypes
* once the install script is done, configure your webserver to serve files from the httpdocs folder

```apacheconfig
#Example Apache2 Configuration
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName web-core-skeleton-basic.local
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/web-core-skeleton-basic/httpdocs
    <Directory "/var/www/vhosts/web-core-skeleton-basic/httpdocs">
        Order allow, deny
        Allow from all
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

* for security reasons all application and library files live outside the webservers document_root
* please make shure that no php open_basedir restrictions prevent php from accessing the folders directly above httpdocs

## 2. Import from pressmind速
To import data from pressmind速 run the script application/cli/import.php

To first test the import functionality it is a good idea to import a single media object from pressmind速
```shell script
# Import single media object (123456 represents a valid media object id in your pressmind速 userspace)
php import.php mediaobject 123456
```

Point your browser to the detail.php example script of your virtual host with an id-parameter:   
http://web-core-skeleton-basic.local/detail.php?id=123456  
You now should see the rendered output of the currently imported media object.

Check the logs folder (application/logs) for error messages if something is not working as expected.

To do a fullimport (which is recommended after a fresh install) add the argument fullimport
```shell script
# Full Import
php import.php fullimport
```
Depending on the amount of data that is stored in pressmind, the full import can last a while.  
For each media object all descriptive and touristic data will be imported into the database. Additionally all related files and images will be downloaded to the folder httpdocs/assets.


## 3. Configure crontab
add the line to you're crontab. The cron job is run's the scheduler, see config.json for advanced configuration.
```
* * * * * php /your/install/path/application/cli/cron.php  > /dev/null 2>&1
```
